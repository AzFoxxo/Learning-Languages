# Learning-Languages

This repo is a quick reference I use for learning programming concepts or whole languages/tech stacks I'm not familiar with

The include should not be seen as good examples for learning as it misses out stuff I already understand and comments are written as if you are proficient with programming.

Most of the examples are from following tutorials and making chages to ensure I understand the concepts.

## Included so far
- C++ basics and notes from learning it
- Haskell basics
- Ruby basics
- Rust basics 
- Super basics of JavaScript
- Advanced C# features and features I want to familiarise myself with
